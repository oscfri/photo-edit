# TODO

## Base Functionality

This is what's left for a feature complete MVP. 

- [X] Export image
- [X] Save album/project
- [ ] Import images
- [ ] Linear mask

## Refinement

- [ ] Crop UX. It's not very intuitive right now.
- [ ] Ensure crop can't be outside image.
- [ ] Parameter formulas. They don't look very good right now.
- [ ] Radial mask width and height
- [ ] Radial mask rotation
- [ ] Radial mask feathering
- [ ] Prevent artifacts during exports (lines when exporting weird aspect ratios)

## Features that require substantial work

- [ ] Undo/redo
