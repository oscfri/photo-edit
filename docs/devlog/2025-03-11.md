I'm not particularly good at photography, but it's a hobby I've been doing for quite some time. Admittedly I'm not doing it as much as I really want. It's mostly the thing I do when I'm traveling to different countries. I usually capture lots of photos when I'm abroad. Once I'm home, I look through all the pictures and do all the editing work.

The moment of capturing the picture is only a small part of the creative work of photography. Most of the work comes afterwards.

Favorites must be picked. The photo must be straightened and cropped. The brightness and colors must be adjusted because I used poor camera settings when the photo was taking. Sometimes I have to adjust the brightness in a particular region to control where the attention is drawn.

Once all of the above is done, I pick favorites among the edited photos again for the final export. Maybe I want to publish it to some social media. Maybe I want to print it and put it on the wall. Or maybe I want to send the pictures to family or friends.

For these photo editing needs, I've been subscriber to a popular propertiary software. The subscription fee is a bit pricey, but it has served me quite well. Most of the functionality I want has been there.

However, with a new hike in subscription costs it has been difficult for me to justify to continue paying for it.

It's constantly nagging about buying more cloud space even if I'm not particularly interested in it. Lag is noticeable for many tasks I don't think should be that resource intensive. And there's a shift in focus towards providing AI features - which is not what I want when I'm editing photos.

I'm forced to pay more. In return, I get features I don't want. Old problems are still there. Doesn't sound like a lucrative deal.

Currently my main driver for my personal home computer is Windows 10. It's not an operating system I'm a huge fan over, but it's decent for video games, which is my main source of entertainment.

I feel like many other people that Windows 10 is likely the last Windows version I'm going to use. I've heard that gaming on Linux is actually decent now, so I might make that move.

However, if I want to fully make the shift to Linux, I want to ensure I have a photo editing software I can use. I decided I wanted to create my own photo editing software. It feels like something that shouldn't be too hard for me to do.

There are four reasons why I wanted to do it myself:
- I want a software that supports my photo editing workflow well
- I want to have the control over my photo editing workflow
- I haven't had a proper hobby programming project in a while
- It could be a good learning experience

This was good enough reasons for me. So I got to work.

## The Project

At the time of writing, I've been working on this on and off for 2 months. Most of the base functionality is in place, and I feel confident I can pull the project through.

I think it's good to have a specific goal in mind when working a project. For me, that goal is to make a photo editing software that's capable enough that I can use it myself. I have a fairly good idea of which set of features this entails. Once these have been implemented, I would consider that I have finished a first proper version of the software.

I don't want to fall into the trap of being a feature creep. Last thing I want to do is to overwhelm myself with all kinds of dream features. First and foremost, I must prioritize the features I really need. I have many ideas of how to expand the project later beyond the first version, but that's for later.

So what are the features I need? To support my usual workflow, I need to implement:

- Batch import of images
- Filtering of images
- Basic adjusting of images (exposure, contrast, saturation, etc.)
- Cropping and rotation
- Regional masking (radial and linear masks)
- Saving above settings
- Batch export

Most of these features are implemented by now.

To spice things up a bit, I also used this opportunity to properly learn a language I've been curious about for a while. That language is Rust. Prior to this project, I've only used Rust for smaller weekend projects - which is far from enough to fully know a programming language.

In my day to day work I mainly use Java. In my potentially highly controversial opinion, I think Java is a fine language (for work). Even if I'm fine with Java as a programming language, I don't want to work all day in Java, just to continue working with Java in my spare time as well. Using Rust is a good way to distance this hobby project from my work. The last thing I want to do is to associate my hobby with work.

## My Verdict of Rust

I like Rust so far. It's probably the right choice for this project. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to structure a Rust program, but I feel like I'm approaching a style that could allow for my program to grow without much friction.

There have admittedly been some paint points with Rust however. A few times I've started with a feature I thought was going to be easy to implement, only to realize I've cornered myself in Rust's borrow checker puzzle. This caused me to rework much larger sections of the program than I initially wanted, and an entire afternoon is lost on this work.

The good thing is that even if I've made a larger refactoring, the program is still in a good shape after I'm done with the refactoring. I'm confident that if I would've used C or C++ instead, I would've been spending far much more time trying to debug memory errors that creep in during all the refactoring work. With Rust, if it compiles, then I can feel pretty confident that the program will work (unless I work on the wgpu shaders).

If I had to pick my top favorite thing about Rust, I would say it's Cargo. It's a build system that just works. Cargo barely needs any configration to get started. It's trivial to import external packages. I don't know of any other build system that works nearly as well as Cargo. 

Maven is still a mystery to me even if I use it every day. Cmake configuration is like a programming language itself. Everytime I return to Python there's a new package manager everybody is supposed to use because all the old ones were too painful to use. I remember having many struggles with NuGet and .NET when C# was my main work language (although I've surpressed most of those memories).

Cargo, it just works.

Let's see how my view of Rust changes over time, but right now it's at a great start for me.
